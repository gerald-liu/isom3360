|-----:|:--------------|----------:|
|    4 | M. Neuer      |         0 |
|    6 | De Gea        |         0 |

|   76 | D. Suba?i?    |         0 |

The players in cluster 0 are bad at all skills mentioned above, because these features are not used to evaulate them in real life. They have GK attributes that are not included in our analysis.

Most of them (if not all of them) are goal keepers.
